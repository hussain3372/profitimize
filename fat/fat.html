        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The Body Fat Calculator is a comprehensive tool designed to help individuals determine their body fat
            percentage accurately. It takes into account essential factors such as gender, age, weight, and height to
            provide a personalized calculation. Understanding your body fat percentage is crucial for assessing your
            overall health and fitness levels. This calculator is easy to use and provides quick results, making it an
            excellent resource for anyone looking to monitor their body composition.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Gender:</strong> The first step in using the Body Fat Calculator is selecting your gender. This is
            important because body fat distribution and composition can vary significantly between males and females.
            The calculator provides two options: male and female. Simply click on the appropriate radio button to select
            your gender.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Age:</strong> Age is another critical factor in determining body fat percentage. As we age, our body
            composition changes, and understanding these changes can help in setting realistic fitness and health goals.
            Enter your age in the designated input field. Make sure to input your correct age for accurate results.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Weight:</strong> The next step involves entering your weight. The Body Fat Calculator uses weight as
            one of the parameters to determine the body fat percentage. Enter your weight in kilograms in the input
            field provided. Accurate weight measurement is crucial for reliable results.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Height:</strong> Height is another essential measurement needed for the calculation. Enter your
            height in centimeters in the designated input field. This information, combined with your weight, helps in
            assessing your body mass index (BMI), which is a component of the body fat calculation.
            <br><br>
            Once you have entered all the required information, click on the "Calculate Body Fat" button to obtain your
            results. The calculator will process the data and provide you with detailed results, including your body fat
            percentage, body fat category, fat mass, and lean mass.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Results:</strong> The results section of the Body Fat Calculator provides a comprehensive analysis
            of your body composition.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Body Fat Percentage:</strong> This is the primary result provided by the calculator. It represents
            the proportion of your body weight that is made up of fat. Knowing your body fat percentage can help you
            assess your fitness level and make informed decisions about your diet and exercise routines.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Body Fat Category:</strong> Based on your body fat percentage, the calculator will classify you into
            different categories such as underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese. This categorization helps in
            understanding where you stand in terms of health and fitness.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Fat Mass:</strong> This result indicates the total amount of fat in your body. It is calculated by
            multiplying your body fat percentage by your total weight. Monitoring your fat mass is essential for
            tracking changes in body composition over time.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Lean Mass:</strong> Lean mass represents the weight of everything in your body except fat, including
            muscles, bones, water, and organs. This is an important metric for understanding your overall muscle mass
            and physical strength.
            <br><br>
            The Body Fat Calculator is an invaluable tool for anyone looking to gain insights into their body
            composition. Whether you are on a fitness journey, trying to lose weight, or simply want to maintain a
            healthy lifestyle, this calculator provides you with the information you need to track your progress and
            make informed decisions about your health. Remember, maintaining a healthy body fat percentage is crucial
            for overall well-being, and using this calculator regularly can help you stay on top of your fitness goals.
